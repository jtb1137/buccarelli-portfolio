        <p>
          My name is Jake Buccarelli. I live in Philadelphia, PA, and I build websites and full-stack applications. I love everything
          tech, and I want to share this love with the world by building beautiful, innovative user experiences. I left my
          career in pharmaceutical advertising to embark on this amazing journey, and after a year of intense study, consistent
          practice, and perfecting the art of caffination, I couldn’t be happier that I took the leap. As a lifelong techie
          turned freelance developer, I look forward to waking up every day to new challenges, new opportunities to learn,
          and new JavaScript frameworks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of programming, I enjoy travelling to new places, trying new foods, and finding the perfect coffee bean for my personal
          cold brew. I’m a beer snob who’s developed a fondness for IPAs and imperial stouts, and I spend too much time watching
          movies. A dedicated weightlifter that loves being in the gym, but also a hobbyist gamer with a soft spot for RPGs.
          When I'm not exploring the historic streets of Old City, Philadelphia with my girlfriend, you can find me endulging
          my Italian heritage with cannolis from Randazzo's, a northern New Jersey bakery from my childhood.
