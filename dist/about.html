        <p>
          My name is Jake Buccarelli. I live in Philadelphia, PA, and I build websites and full-stack applications. I love everything
          tech, and I want to share this love with the world by building beautiful, innovative user experiences. I left my
          career in pharmaceutical advertising to embark on this amazing journey, and after a year of intense study, consistent
          practice, and perfecting the art of caffination, I couldn’t be happier that I took the leap. As a lifelong techie
          turned freelance developer, I look forward to waking up every day to new challenges, new opportunities to learn,
          and new JavaScript frameworks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of programming, I enjoy travelling to new places, trying new foods, and finding the perfect coffee bean for my personal
          cold brew. I’m a beer snob who’s developed a fondness for IPAs and imperial stouts, and I spend too much time watching
          movies. When I'm not exploring the historic streets of Old City, Philadelphia with my girlfriend, you can find
          me in the gym or playing the latest mulitplayer online video games with friends.
